# Title: Deep Learning for Breast Cancer Detection: A Comprehensive Survey and Implementation

# Description:
This  project is submitted as part of the Computational Intelligence MSc Embedded Computing System course. This project is dedicated to exploring and applying deep learning techniques to the task of breast cancer detection, utilizing a  dataset of medical images.

# Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to conduct an exhaustive survey of deep learning techniques and to implement a robust methodology for breast cancer detection. The repository comprehensively documents the procedures and methods employed to fulfill the five designated tasks, including both traditional and innovative approaches to ensure a work of high quality and effectiveness.

# Chapter Breakdown
1. Introduction (Task One):
In the inaugural chapter, I present an insightful introduction that consolidates a collection of relevant papers and research findings. I emphasize the most intriguing and valuable resources discovered, setting the stage for subsequent chapters.

2. Binary Classification (Task Two):
This segment delves into the intricacies of binary classification, providing an in-depth exploration of the classification process starting from scratch. The chapter sheds light on the methodologies and insights I gained during this fundamental phase.

3. Categorical Classification (Task Three):
Task Three is divided into two equal parts focusing on categorical classification. I elucidate my approach to classification, examining both from-scratch methodologies and leveraging pre-trained networks such as VGG16 and INCEPTION V3. Importantly, the baseline patch is not considered in this classification, as its analysis is reserved for the subsequent chapter.

4. Baseline Analysis (Task Four):
The fourth chapter scrutinizes the viability of incorporating baseline information to enhance the accuracy of abnormality classification. This exploration aims to contribute insights into the role of baseline data in refining the detection process.

5. Model Ensemble (Task Five):
Dedicated to the amalgamation of the best models obtained, this chapter explores the technique of ensemble learning. By combining top-performing models, my goal is to create a more resilient and efficient classifier that surpasses the capabilities of individual models.

Conclusion
The concluding chapter serves as a comprehensive overview of the entire project, offering insightful discussions on results, methodologies, and potential directions for future work. This section serves as a reflective synthesis of the project's achievements and paves the way for further exploration in the dynamic field of medical imaging analysis.
