# CNN-implementations-for-Medical-Imaging-Analysis
A project submitted for the course of Computational Intelligence MSc Embedded Computing System

The goal of the project is to perfom a survey of deep learning techniques to detect breast cancer using a dataset made of images.

The report in this repository aims to cover all the procedures and methods implemented to analyze and complete
the five tasks of the project. Besides the usual techniques, additional ones have been used and all the details are provided in order to
cover and ensure an high quality work level.

The first chapter is related to the task one. An introduction to the collection of all the papers and
researches that I found, underlying the most interesting and useful for my purposes.

The second and third chapter are related to task two and three. They are divided in equal parts
for binary and categorical classification.
The second chapter aims to classify from scratch, whereas
the third use pre-trained network as VGG16, and INCEPTION V3. The classification described
does not takes into account the baseline patch, considered that this feature has been described in
chapter four.

The fourth chapter aims to analyze if it is possible to use the baseline in order to classifiy the
abnormality correctly.

The fifth chapter is related in how to ensemble the best models obtained in order to create a
better classifier that can overcome the single models.

The latter is an overall on the entire work, discussing results, techniques and possible future
works
